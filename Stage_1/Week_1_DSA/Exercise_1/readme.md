# Inventory Management System

## Overview

The Inventory Management System is a Java-based application designed for managing warehouse inventory. It supports essential operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and displaying products. The system is built to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval, crucial for managing large inventories effectively.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

### Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms

Efficient data storage and retrieval are vital for managing extensive inventories. Choosing the right data structure enables quick operations for adding, removing, or updating product information, thus enhancing productivity and handling large datasets more effectively.

### Suitable Data Structures

1. **ArrayList**:

   - **Description**: A dynamic array that provides flexible size management and easy implementation. It allows straightforward traversal and storage of similar data types.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for dynamic product counts where indexed access is necessary.

2. **HashMap**:

   - **Description**: Offers fast lookups, inserts, and deletions using keys. It provides efficient access to elements, beneficial for inventory management.
   - **Use Case**: Best for scenarios requiring rapid retrieval of product information by unique identifiers, such as product IDs.

3. **TreeMap**:
   - **Description**: Maintains sorted keys and supports efficient range queries. Useful for accessing or sorting products based on specific criteria.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for situations where products need to be accessed in a sorted order or categorized.

### Time Complexity Analysis

The `ArrayList` data structure has been used in this implementation. Here’s the time complexity analysis for each operation:

#### Addition

- **Operation**: Adding a product to the `ArrayList`.
  - **Average Case**: \( O(1) \) – Adding an element at the end of the list is generally constant time.
  - **Worst Case**: \( O(n) \) – Resizing the internal array requires copying, making the time complexity \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements.

#### Update

- **Operation**: Updating a product in the `ArrayList`.
  - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \) – Requires a full traversal to find the product with the matching ID.

#### Deletion

- **Operation**: Deleting a product from the `ArrayList`.
  - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \) – Involves traversal to find the product and shifting subsequent elements to fill the gap.

## Optimization Suggestions

While `ArrayList` offers simplicity, it has time complexity considerations:

- **Addition**: \( O(1) \) on average, but \( O(n) \) in worst-case due to resizing.
- **Update**: \( O(n) \) due to traversal.
- **Deletion**: \( O(n) \) due to traversal and shifting elements.

For scenarios requiring faster operations, particularly for updates and deletions, consider alternative data structures like `HashMap` or `TreeMap` that provide better time complexity for these operations.
