# Financial Projection

This project demonstrates the use of recursion in financial forecasting by calculating the future value of an investment given an initial amount, an annual growth rate, and the number of periods. The concept of recursion is utilized to simplify the problem.

## Understanding Recursive Algorithms

### Concept of Recursion

Recursion is a technique where a function solves a problem by calling itself on smaller instances of the same problem. It consists of two main parts: the base case, which stops the recursion, and the recursive case, which divides the problem into smaller subproblems.

### How Recursion Simplifies Problems

- **Breaking Down Complex Problems:** Makes complex tasks manageable by breaking them into simpler subproblems.
- **Reduction to Base Cases:** Achieves simple, solvable cases by gradually reducing the problem.
- **Elegant and Concise Code:** Results in more readable and maintainable code.
- **Handling Dynamic Data Structures:** Naturally adapts to structures like trees and graphs for traversal.

### Time Complexity of the Recursive Algorithm

The time complexity of the `calculateFutureValue` recursive algorithm is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of periods. This complexity arises because each recursive call reduces the number of periods by one, and the function is called \( n \) times until the base case is reached.

## Optimization to Avoid Excessive Computation

Recursion can sometimes lead to excessive computation and stack overflow issues, especially with deep recursions. To optimize recursive solutions and mitigate these problems, consider the following techniques:

### 1. Memoization

Memoization is a technique used to store the results of expensive function calls and reuse these results when the same inputs occur again. It helps to avoid redundant computations and improve performance.

### 2. Iterative Approach

An iterative approach can be used to avoid the overhead of recursive calls. By using a loop, we can achieve the same result without the risk of stack overflow.
